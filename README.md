The American military recruits and trains a tremendous amount of new personnel every year.  To match people with skills, the armed forces recruits must take a test called the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The grade received on the ASVAB determines whether a prospective recruit will be allowed to enlist for his career field of choice.   This study will try to determine if the the ASVAB is an indicator of future success.

The ASVAB was first introduced in 1968 and was adopted by all branches of the military in 1976. It underwent a major revision in 2002. In 2004, the test's percentile rank scoring system was renormalized, to ensure that a score of 50% really did represent doing better than exactly 50% of the test takers.

This application looks at ASVAB scores across three years and examines the difference in distribution between all students, students who successfully graduated and students who failed.
